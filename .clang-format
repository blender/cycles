# Disallow short functions on one line; break them up.
AllowShortBlocksOnASingleLine: false

# These two settings trigger stacking of parameters in most cases; this is
# easier to read and also makes diffs easier to read (since an added or removed
# parameter is obvious). For example, function calls will look like this:
#
#   like_this_long_name(parameter_one,
#                       parameter_two,
#                       parameter_three,
#                       parameter_four,
#                       parameter_five,
#                       parameter_six);
#
# Instead of:
#
#   like_this_long_name(parameter_one, parameter_two, parameter_three, parameter_four,
#                       parameter_five, parameter_six);
